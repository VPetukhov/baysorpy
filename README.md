# Baysor-py

This is a python package wrapping and extending functionality of the julia [Baysor](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor) package.

**WARNING:** this is work in progress, and the interface will be changed a lot before the final release.

Please, keep in mind that Julia uses JIT-compilation, so the first call to every Baysor function will usually take much longer than subsequent calls.

To install the package, run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/VPetukhov/baysorpy.git
```
